Distributed locks are crucial in distributed systems to ensure that multiple nodes don't concurrently modify shared resources. This snippet demonstrates how to implement distributed locks in Go.

## Distributed Lock with Etcd

Etcd provides strong consistency and is a great option for implementing distributed locks. Below is an implementation using the `go.etcd.io/etcd/clientv3` package:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	clientv3 "go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3"
	"go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3/concurrency"
)

func main() {
	client, err := clientv3.New(clientv3.Config{
		Endpoints:   []string{"localhost:2379"},
		DialTimeout: 5 * time.Second,
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer client.Close()

	session, err := concurrency.NewSession(client)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer session.Close()

	mutex := concurrency.NewMutex(session, "/my-lock/")
	if err := mutex.Lock(context.Background()); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Lock acquired!")
	// Perform your critical section work here.
	time.Sleep(8 * time.Second) // Simulate work

	if err := mutex.Unlock(context.Background()); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Lock released!")
}
```

## Best Practices

- Always set a reasonable expiration time to avoid deadlocks if the process holding the lock crashes.
- Use unique identifiers, such as UUIDs, for each lock value to ensure proper lock release.
- Ensure the distributed locking system is highly available to prevent a single point of failure.
- Consider using TTL (Time To Live) to automatically release locks that have been held too long.

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to release the lock can lead to resource starvation. Ensure you release the lock in a `defer` statement whenever possible.
- Relying on a single point of failure for the lock service can lead to system outage. Always configure redundancy and backups.
- Improper handling of lock expiration can lead to race conditions. Consider implementing a heart-beat mechanism for extending lock durations safely.

## Performance Tips

- Use a dedicated, fast, and consistent data store for managing your distributed locks.
- Consider lock contention strategies to reduce the blocking time for nodes trying to acquire the lock.
- Optimize network latency between distributed nodes and the lock management service for faster lock acquisition and release.
- Monitor and log lock usage patterns to identify and optimize bottlenecks in your system.
