When developing system-level applications in Go, handling operating system (OS) signals is essential for managing application lifecycle events such as graceful shutdowns or specific signal-based actions. Go provides the `os/signal` package to capture and handle these signals effectively.

## Basic OS Signal Handling

Here's a simple example showing how to capture and handle SIGINT and SIGTERM:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"os/signal"
	"syscall"
)

func main() {
	// Create a channel to receive notifications of incoming signals.
	signalChan := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	
	// Notify the channel when a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal is received.
	signal.Notify(signalChan, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)

	// Block until we receive a signal.
	sig := <-signalChan
	fmt.Printf("Received signal: %s, shutting down...\n", sig)
}
```

## Graceful Shutdown Example

This example demonstrates how to perform cleanup operations before shutting down an application:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"os/signal"
	"syscall"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Create a context with cancellation capability.
	ctx, stop := signal.NotifyContext(context.Background(), syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)
	defer stop()

	fmt.Println("Service is running. Press Ctrl+C to stop.")

	// Simulate long-running process.
	select {
	case <-ctx.Done():
		// Perform cleanup operations before exiting.
		fmt.Println("Shutting down gracefully...")
		cleanup()
	}
}

func cleanup() {
	fmt.Println("Performing cleanup tasks...")
	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) // Simulated cleanup duration.
	fmt.Println("Cleanup completed.")
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use `signal.NotifyContext` for a context-based signal handling approach, which integrates well with Go's concurrency model.
- Always defer a cleanup or stop function to ensure resources are freed and cleanup tasks are completed, even if the program exits unexpectedly.
- Prefer handling signals in a separate goroutine if you have other concurrent jobs to prevent blocking the main execution flow.
- Consider using `NotifyContext` with one or more signals to ease signal management across different parts of your application.

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to call `signal.Stop` on a channel when you no longer need to receive signals, which might lead to resource leakage.
- Relying solely on `os.Exit` to handle program shutdowns without performing any cleanup can result in data corruption or resource leakage.
- Over-complicating signal handlers by placing too much logic in them instead of delegating tasks elsewhere within the application.

## Performance Tips

- For highly concurrent programs, use buffered channels to avoid blocking on signal notifications.
- Consolidate signal handling logic to minimize system calls and context-switching costs.
- Ensure any non-trivial cleanup code in signal handlers is optimized for performance, especially when signals are expected frequently.

Handling OS signals appropriately is vital for building robust and reliable applications that can gracefully respond to termination requests. Incorporate these patterns and tips to enhance your Go application's signal handling capabilities.
